# Macro-Counter
Web program for Macro Counter CS260

## Elevator Pitch
We would all agree that a healthier lifestyle starts with what you eat. For many of us, it is so difficult to eat better and achieve our healthier lifestyle goals because of how difficult it can be to track your progress. The macro counter application aims to make those difficult and tedious tasks of tracking macronutrients so much simpler. It will allow you to log into a profile and log the total grams of macronutrients you have consumed for each meal of the day. The app will then allow you to easily view the total number of calories you have consumed and the data from previous days. You can even link profiles with a friend so you can help each other reach their goals.

### Key Features
1. Sign in page to load users' data previously logged.
2. Calendar view to load data logged from previous days.
3. Data entry page where the user can select a meal of the day and enter the macronutrients of that meal.
4. Friends page to track another user's progress.

#### Technologies Description
**_Authentication_**  
A user can create a profile and log into an existing profile with a username and password that will then allow them to load previously logged data.

**_Database Data_**  
Previously logged meals will be stored in a database and then shown when the user enters the calendar view.

**_WebSocket Data_**  
Users will be able to chat with their friends to encourage and congratulate them on their goals and progress.
