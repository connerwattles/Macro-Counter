# The Console

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Command line crash course](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Command_line)

Before the creation of graphical user interfaces, all computing systems were simple console environments consisting as of a prompt for inputting a command and the display of the command output. All of the original programming tools ran as console application. The console tradition is still actively used by professional developers and most programming tools execute within a console window.

Also known as the command line, shell, or terminal, the console window is an essential web development tool. The console provides access to the file system and allows for the execution of command line applications.

There are many console applications that you can chose from. All operating systems come with a default console, but you will probably want to install one in order to get the best experience.

## Make sure you have a console application

In order for you to successfully use the console for web programming it must be [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant. POSIX compliance means that it supports a standard set of console commands. Both Mac and Linix support POSIX. That means any necessary console commands will work on those operating systems.

### Testing your console application

Once you have a acceptable console application on your development computer, open it up and make sure you can run a simple POSIX compliant command such as `printf 'hello\n'`.

![Console printf](consolePrintf.jpg)

If this displays `hello` then you are on the right track. If that doesn't work then you are using a console application that is not POSIX compliant. For example, Windows Powershell will not work.

## Viewing the file system

One of the primary purposes of a console application is to view the files on the computer. The files on a computer are organized into a tree structure of nodes called directories. At any given point in time your console is located at one of the directories in the file system. You can see which directory you are in with the `pwd` (present working directory) command.

```sh
➜  pwd

/Users/student/byu//webprogramming260
```

You can list all of the files in the directory with `ls` (list files). Most command line applications take parameters that are specified after you type the application name. For example, `ls` can list all files (even hidden ones) in a long format if you provide the parameter `-la`.

```sh
➜ ls -la

total 16
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff   1.0K Nov 19 08:47 LICENSE
-rw-r--r--  1 lee  staff    82B Nov 19 08:47 README.md
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:48 profile
drwxr-xr-x  4 lee  staff   128B Nov 19 08:47 react
```

## Executing commands

The other primary purpose of the console is to execute commands. You already did this in the previous section when you executed commands for working with the file system. However, console commands can perform many different operations. Here are some basic commands that you show experiment with.

- **echo** - Output the parameters of the command
- **cd** - Change directory
- **mkdir** - Make directory
- **rmdir** - Remove directory
- **rm** - Remove file(s)
- **mv** - Move file(s)
- **cp** - Copy files
- **ls** - List files
- **curl** - Command line client URL browser
- **grep** - Regular expression search
- **find** - Find files
- **top** - View running processes with CPU and memory usage
- **df** - View disk statistics
- **cat** - Output the contents of a file
- **less** - Interactively output the contents of a file
- **wc** - Count the words in a file
- **ps** - View the currently running processes
- **kill** - Kill a currently running process
- **sudo** - Execute a command as a super user (admin)
- **ssh** - Create a secure shell on a remote computer
- **scp** - Securely copy files to a remote computer
- **history** - Show the history of commands
- **ping** - Check if a website is up
- **tracert** - Trace the connections to a website
- **dig** - Show the DNS information for a domain
- **man** - Look up a command in the manual
- **chmod** - Change permissions for a file or directory on a Unix machine
- **wget** - lets you download files and interact with REST APIs. It supports the HTTP , HTTPS , FTP , and FTPS internet protocols.

You can also chain the input and output of commands using special characters

- `|` - Take the output from the command on the left and _pipe_, or pass, it to the command on the right
- `>` - Redirect output to a file. Overwrites the file if it exists
- `>>` - Redirect output to a file. Appends if the file exists

For example, you can list the files in a directory, pipe it into `grep` to search for files created in Nov, and then pipe that into `wc` to count the number of files found with a date of Nov.

```
ls -l | grep ' Nov ' | wc -l
```

There are also keystrokes that have special meaning in the console.

- `CTRL-R` - Use type ahead to find previous commands
- `CTRL-C` - Kill the currently running command



















# The internet

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN How does the Internet work?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/How_does_the_Internet_work)
- [YouTube The Internet in 5 Minutes](https://youtu.be/7_LPdttKXPc)

The internet globally connects independent networks and computing devices. In a simplistic way, you can think of the internet as a massive redundant collection of wires that connect up all the computers in the world. A lot of those wires are wireless (wiFi, satellite, or cell), and not all of computers in the world are connected, but generally that is what the internet is. The deeper your mental model of the internet is, the more effectively you will be able to create web applications.

![Internet connections](internetConnections.jpg)

## Making connections

When one device wants to talk to another it must have an IP address. For example, `128.187.16.184` is BYU's address. Usually, human users prefer a symbolic name over an IP address. The symbolic name is called a domain name. Domain names are converted to IP address by doing a lookup in the Domain Name System (DNS). You can look up the IP address for any domain name using the `dig` console utility.

```sh
➜  dig byu.edu

byu.edu.		5755	IN	A	128.187.16.184
```

![Internet requests](internetRequests.jpg)

Once you have the IP address, you connect to the device it represents by first asking for a connection route to the device. A connection route consists of many hops across the network until the destination is dynamically discovered and the connection established. With the connection the transport and application layers start exchanging data.

### Traceroute

You can determine the hops in a connection using the `traceroute` console utility. In the following example, we trace the route between a home computer and BYU. In the result you see the first address `192.168.1.1`. This is the address of the network router the home computer is connected to. From there it goes through a couple devices that do not identify themselves and then hits the Google Fiber gateway. Google Fiber is the internet service provider, or ISP, for the requesting device. Then we jump through a few more unidentified devices before finally arriving at BYU (`128.187.16.184`).

```sh
➜  traceroute byu.edu

traceroute to byu.edu (128.187.16.184), 64 hops max, 52 byte packets
 1  192.168.1.1 (192.168.1.1)  10.942 ms  4.055 ms  4.694 ms
 2  * * *
 3  * * *
 4  192-119-18-212.mci.googlefiber.net (192.119.18.212)  5.369 ms  5.576 ms  6.456 ms
 5  216.21.171.197 (216.21.171.197)  6.283 ms  6.767 ms  5.532 ms
 6  * * *
 7  * * *
 8  * * *
 9  byu.com (128.187.16.184)  7.544 ms !X *  40.231 ms !X

```

If I run traceroute again I might see a slightly different route since every connection through the internet is dynamically calculated. The ability to discover a route makes the internet resilient when network devices fail or disappear from the network.

## Network internals

The actual sending of data across the internet uses the TCP/IP model. This is a layered architecture that covers everything from the physical wires to the data that a web application sends. At the top of the TCP/IP protocol is the application layer. It represents user functionality, such as the web (HTTP), mail (SMTP), files (FTP), remote shell (SSH), and chat (IRC). Underneath that is the transport layer which breaks the application layer's information into small chunks and sends the data. The actual connection is made using the internet layer. This finds the device you want to talk to and keeps the connection alive. Finally, at the bottom of the model is the link layer which deals with the physical connections and hardware.

### [TCP/IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite) layers

| Layer       | Example         | Purpose                               |
| ----------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Application | HTTPS           | Functionality like web browsing       |
| Transport   | TCP             | Moving connection information packets |
| Internet    | IP              | Establishing connections              |
| Link        | Fiber, hardware | Physical connections                  |






# Web servers

A web server is a computing device that is hosting a web service that knows how to accept incoming internet connections and speak the HTTP application protocol.

## Monolithic web servers

In the early days of web programming, you would buy a massive, complex, expensive, software program that spoke HTTP and installed on a hardware server. The package of server and software was considered the web server because the web service software was the only thing running on the server.

When Berners-Lee wrote his first web server it only served up static HTML files. This soon advanced so that they allowed dynamic functionality, including the ability to generate all the HTML on demand in response to a users interaction. That facilitated what we now know as modern web applications.

## Combining web and application services

Today, most modern programming languages include libraries that provide the ability to make connections and serve up HTTP. For example, here is a simple Go language program that is a fully functioning web service. Later on in the course we will show how this is done with JavaScript.

```go
package main

import (
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
}
```

Being able to easily create web services makes it easy to completely drop the monolithic web server concept and just build web services right into your web application. With our simple `go` example we can add a function that responds with the current time, when the `/api/time` resource is requested.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"net/http"
	"time"
)

func getTime(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	io.WriteString(w, time.Now().String())
}

func main() {
	// Serve up files found in the public_html directory
	fs := http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public_html"))
	http.Handle("/", fs)

	// Dynamically provide data
	http.HandleFunc("/api/time", getTime)

	// Listen for HTTP requests
	fmt.Println(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil))
}
```

We can run that web service code, and use the console application `Curl` to make an HTTP request and see the time response.

```sh
➜  curl localhost:3000/api/time

2022-12-03 09:50:37.391983 -0700
```

## Web service gateways

Since it is so easy to build web services it is common to find multiple web services running on the same computing device. The trick is exposing the multiple services in a way that a connection can be made to each of them. Every network device allows for separate network connections by referring to a unique port number. Each service on the device starts up on a different port. In the example above, the `go` web service was using port 80. So you could just have a user access each service by referring to the port it was launched on. However, this makes it difficult for the user of the services to remember what port matches to which service. To resolve this we introduce a service gateway, or sometimes called a reverse proxy, that is itself a simple web service that listens on the common HTTPS port 443. The gateway then looks at the request and maps it to the other services running on a different ports.

![Gateway](webServersGateway.jpg)

Our web server will use the application `Caddy` as the gateway to our services. The details of how Caddy works will be given later.

## Microservices

Web services that provide a single functional purpose are referred to as microservices. By partitioning functionality into small logical chunks, you can develop and manage them independently from other functionality in a larger system. They can also handle large fluctuations in user demand by simply running more and more stateless copies of the microservice from multiple virtual servers hosted in a dynamic cloud environment. For example, one microservice for generating your genealogical family tree might be able to handle 1,000 users concurrently. So in order to support 1 million users, you just deploy 1,000 instances of the service running on scalable virtual hardware.

## Serverless

The idea of microservices naturally evolved into the world of `serverless` functionality where the server is conceptually removed from the architecture and you just write a function that speaks HTTP. That function is loaded through an gateway that maps a web request to the function. The gateway automatically scales the hardware needed to host the serverless function based on demand. This reduces what the web application developer needs to think about down to a single independent function.




# Domain names

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN What is a Domain Name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_domain_name)

In the instruction about the internet we showed how an IP address can be referenced by a domain name. You can get the IP address for any domain using the `dig` console utility. Notice that in the following example there are actually multiple IP addresses associated with the domain name `amazon.com`. This allows for redundancy in case one of the IP addresses fails to successfully resolve to a valid connection because the server listening at that IP address is not responding.

```sh
➜  dig amazon.com

amazon.com.		126	IN	A	205.251.242.103
amazon.com.		126	IN	A	52.94.236.248
amazon.com.		126	IN	A	54.239.28.85
```

A domain name is simply a text string that follows a specific naming convention and is listed in a special database called the domain name registry.

Domain names are broken up into a root domain, with one or more possible subdomain prefixes. The root domain is represented by a secondary level domain and a top level domain. The top level domain (TLD) represent things like `com`, `edu`, or `click`. So a root domain would look something like `byu.edu`, `google.com`, or `cs260.click`. The [possible list of TLDs](https://www.icann.org/resources/pages/tlds-2012-02-25-en) is controlled by ICANN, one of the governing boards of the internet.

![Domain name parts](domainNameParts.jpg)

The owner of a root domain can create any number of subdomains off the root domain. Each subdomain may resolve to a different IP address. So the owner of `cs260.click` can have subdomains for travel (`travel.cs260.click`), finance (`finance.cs260.click`), or a blog (`blog.cs260.click`).

You can get information about a domain name from the domain name registry using the `whois` console utility.

```yaml
➜  whois byu.edu

Domain Name: BYU.EDU

Registrant:
	Brigham Young University
	3009 ITB
	2027 ITB
	Provo, UT 84602
	USA

Administrative Contact:
	Mark Longhurst
	Brigham Young University
	Office of Information Technology
	1208 ITB
	Provo, UT 84602
	USA
	+1.8014220488
	markl@byu.edu

Technical Contact:
	Brent Goodman
	Brigham Young University
	Office of Information Technology
	1203J ITB
	Provo, UT 84602
	USA
	+1.8014227782
	dnsmaster@byu.edu

Domain record activated:    19-Jan-1987
Domain record last updated: 11-Jul-2022
Domain expires:             31-Jul-2025
```

This provides information such as a technical contact to talk to if there is a problem with the domain, and an administrative contact to talk to if you want to buy the domain. Maybe we should talk to Mark and see if he is willing to sell.

## DNS

Once a domain name is in the registry it can be listed with a domain name system (DNS) server and associated with an IP address. Of course you must also lease the IP address before you can use it to uniquely identify a device on the internet, but that is a topic for another time. Every DNS server in the world references a few special DNS servers that are considered the `authoritative name servers` for associating a domain name with an IP address.

The DNS database records that facilitate the mapping of domain names to IP addresses come in several flavors. The main ones we are concerned with are the `address` (`A`) and the `canonical name` (`CNAME`) records. An `A` record is a straight mapping from a domain name to IP address. A `CNAME` record maps one domain name to another domain name. This acts as a domain name alias. You would use a CNAME to do things like map `byu.com` to the same IP address as `byu.edu` so that either one could be used.

When you enter a domain name into a browser, the browser first checks to see if it has the name already in its cache of names. If it does not, it contacts a DNS server and gets the IP address. The DNS server also keeps a cache of names. If the domain name is not in the cache, it will request the name from an `authoritative name server`. If the authority does not know the name then you get an unknown domain name error. If the process does resolve, then the browser makes the HTTP connection to the associated IP address.

As you can see, there is a lot of levels of name caching. This is done for performance reasons, but it also can be frustrating when you are trying to update the information associated with your domain name. This is where the `time to live` (`TTL`) setting for a domain record comes into play. You can set this to be something short like 5 minutes or as long as several days. The different caching layers should then honor the TTL and clear their cache after the requested period has passed.

## Buying a domain name

You can pay to lease an unused domain name for a specific period of time. Before the lease expires, you have the right to extend the lease for an additional amount of time. The cost to buy the domain varies from something like $3 to $200 a year. Buying, or sub-leasing, an existing domain name from a private party can be very expensive, and so you are better off buying something obscure like `idigfor.gold` (currently available for only $101). This is one reason why companies have such strange names these days.




# Caddy

![Caddy](caddyLogo.png)

Caddy is a web service that listens for incoming HTTP requests. Caddy then either serves up the requested static files or routes the request to another web service. This ability to route requests is called a `gateway`, or `reverse proxy`, and allows you to expose multiple web services (i.e. your project services) as a single external web service (i.e. Caddy).

For this course, we use Caddy for the following reasons.

- Caddy handles all of the creation and rotation of web certificates. This allows us to easily support HTTPS.
- Caddy serves up all of your static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. All of your early application work will be hosted as static files.
- Caddy acts as a gateway for subdomain requests to your Simon and startup application services. For example, when a request is made to `simon.yourdomain` Caddy will proxy the request to the Simon application running with node.js as an internal web service.

![Caddy](webServersCaddy.jpg)

Caddy is preinstalled and configured on your server and so you do not need to do anything specifically with it other than configure your root domain name.

## Important Caddy files

As part of the installation of Caddy we created two links in the Ubuntu user's home directory that point to the key Caddy configuration files. There links were created in the home directory so that you do not have to hunt around your server looking for these files.

- **Configuration file**: `~/Caddyfile`

  Contains the definitions for routing HTTP requests that Caddy receives. This is used to determine the location where static HTML files are loaded from, and also to proxy requests into the services you will create later. Except for when you configure the domain name of your server, you should never have to modify this file manually. However, it is good to know how it works in case things go wrong. You can read about this in the [Caddy Server documentation](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile).

- **HTML files**: `~/public_html`

  This is the directory of files that Caddy servers up when requests are made to the root or your web server. This is configured in the Caddyfile discussed above. If you actually look at the Caddyfile you will see that the static file server is mapped to `/usr/share/caddy`. That is the location that the file link in the Ubuntu user's home directory, `~/public_html`, is pointing to.

  ```
  :80 {
        root * /usr/share/caddy
        file_server
  }
  ```

  Therefore, according to this configuration, whenever Caddy receives an HTTP request for any domain name on port 80 it will use the path of the request to find a corresponding file in this directory. For example, a request for `http://yourdomainname/index.html` will look for a file named `index.html` in the `public_html` directory.





# HTTPS, TLS, and web certificates

To this point you have been accessing your web server using HTTP. If you notice your browser has been yelling at you that your connection is `⚠ Not Secure` from the location bar.

![Non-secure website](../amazonWebServicesRoute53/webServerWithHostname.png)

During the first couple decades of the web, it was pretty common for websites to simply use HTTP (non-secure hypertext transport protocol) since it was difficult, non-performant, and expensive to secure the connection. Additionally, most websites just provided access to documents and so it didn't need to protect user's information. Usually, only websites that were doing commerce needed a secure connection. That all changed when computers got faster and the web moved from simple document servers (Web 1.0) to full on web applications (Web 2.0) that accepted information from users and displayed that information within the application. Without a secure connection anyone that had access to the network traffic, at any point, from the user's computer to the server handling the request could easily capture all the data sent in either direction. Remember when we used the console program `traceroute` to show you how many computers your connection goes through. You definitely do not want those computers to have access to your user's sensitive information.

## HTTPS and TLS

The secure version of HTTP is called Secure Hypertext Transport Protocol (`HTTPS`). This is basically HTTP with a negotiated secure connection that happens before any data is exchanged. Having a secure connection means that all the data is encrypted using the [TLS protocol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Transport_Layer_Security). TLS is sometimes referred to by a now unsecure predecessor protocol named SSL. TLS works by negotiating a shared secret that is then used to encrypt data. You can see the actual negotiation that happens by using the console browser based application `curl`, along with the `-v` parameter to see the verbose output of the HTTPS exchange. The `> /dev/null` redirection throws away the actual HTTP response, since we only care about the negotiation, by redirecting the output to the null device.

```sh
➜  curl -v -s https://byu.edu > /dev/null

*   Trying 128.187.16.184:443...
* Connected to byu.edu (128.187.16.184) port 443 (#0)
* ALPN: offers h2
* ALPN: offers http/1.1
*  CAfile: /etc/ssl/cert.pem
*  CApath: none
* (304) (OUT), TLS handshake, Client hello (1):
} [312 bytes data]
* (304) (IN), TLS handshake, Server hello (2):

* (304) (IN), TLS handshake, Finished (20):

* (304) (OUT), TLS handshake, Finished (20):

* SSL connection using TLSv1.3 / AEAD-AES256-GCM-SHA384
* ALPN: server accepted http/1.1
* Server certificate:
*  subject: C=US; ST=Utah; L=Provo; O=Brigham Young University; CN=*.byu.edu
*  start date: Jan 24 00:00:00 2022 GMT
*  expire date: Jan 24 23:59:59 2023 GMT
*  subjectAltName: host "byu.edu" matched cert's "byu.edu"
*  issuer: C=US; O=DigiCert Inc; CN=DigiCert TLS RSA SHA256 2020 CA1
*  SSL certificate verify ok.
```

You can see that the negotiation is fairly complex as it involves multiple steps in the handshake. A core piece of the handshake is the exchange of a web certificate that identifies the domain name of the server creating the secure connection. The browser will compare the certificate domain name to the one represented in the URL and if they don't match, or the certificate is invalid or out of date, it will display a massive warning.

In the example above we asked for `byu.edu` and got a valid certificate for byu.edu and so everything looks great.

## Web certificates

Web certificates are generated by a trusted 3rd party using public/private key encryption. The certificate issuer is responsible for verifying that the certificate owner actually owns the domain name represented by the certificate. Once you have a certificate for your domain name, you can serve the certificate from your web server and then the browser can validate the certificate by using the public keys of the certificate issuer.

Until about 2014 it would cost you hundreds of dollars a year to get a web certificate, and you needed a certificate for every domain and subdomain that you owned. That would cost, even a small company, thousands of dollars a year because the certificates needed to be renewed in order to ensure that it still represented the owner of the domain name and to limit the impact of a stolen certificate.

That all changed when two Mozilla employees created a non-profit called `Let's Encrypt` with the goal of creating trusted web certificates for free. This effectively broke the monopoly that the trusted web certificate issuers had on the industry.

Now using a service like `Let's Encrypt`, and the IETF standard [ACME protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_Certificate_Management_Environment) that they pioneered, anyone who owns a domain name, can dynamically generate and renew a certificate for free. This incredible contribution of critical web technology has made the web safer, and more reliable, for everyone.

Caddy uses Let's Encrypt to generate a web certificate every time an HTTPS request is made for a domain name that Caddy doesn't have a web certificate for. When this happens Caddy asks Let's Encrypt to verify that the domain for the requested certificate is actually owned by the requester. Let's Encrypt does that by telling the requester to return a specific digitally signed response for a temporary URL when an HTTP request to the domain is made. Let's Encrypt then makes the HTTP request, and if successful, issues the certificate to the requester.

If you are interested, you can learn about how the Let's Encrypt generates certificate from their [documentation](https://letsencrypt.org/how-it-works/).

## Enabling HTTPS

Modern browsers now expect web servers to exclusively use HTTPS for all communication. In fact, the next version of HTTP (v3) only supports secure connections. For this reason, you should always support HTTPS for any web application that you build.

You can obtain, and renew, a web certificate by enabling the ACME protocol for your web server and communicating with Let's Encrypt to generate the needed certificates. This is not difficult to do, and many languages such as Rust, Node.js, or Go support this functionality by simply including an additional library.

### Caddy

For our work we are using the web service Caddy to act as a gateway to our different services and to host our static web application files. Caddy has ACME support built into it by default, and so all you need to do is configure Caddy with the domain name for your web server. Here are the steps to take.

⚠ Note that this is one of the few modification that you will manually make to your web server. Most other production changes are completed with automated continuous integration processes.

1. Open a console window.
1. Use the `ssh` console program to shell into your production environment server.

   ```sh
   ➜  ssh -i [key pair file] ubuntu@[yourdomainnamehere]
   ```

   for example,

   ```sh
   ➜  ssh -i ~/keys/production.pem ubuntu@myfunkychickens.click
   ```

1. Edit Caddy's configuration (`Caddyfile`) file found in the ubuntu user's home directory.

   ```sh
   ➜  cd ~
   ➜  vi Caddyfile
   ```

1. Modify the Caddy rule for handling requests to port 80 (HTTP), to instead handle request for your domain name. By not specifying a port the rule will serve up files using port 443 (HTTPS), and any request to port 80 will automatically redirect the browser to port 443. Replace `:80` with your domain name (e.g. `myfunkychickens.click`). Make sure that you delete the colon.

1. Modify the Caddy rules that route the traffic for the two web applications that we will build. To do this replace the two places where `yourdomain` appears with your domain name (e.g. `myfunkychickens.click`).

1. Review the Caddyfile to make sure it looks right. If your domain name was `myfunkychickens.click` it would look like the following.

   ```sh
   myfunkychickens.click {
      root * /usr/share/caddy
      file_server
      header Cache-Control no-store
      header -etag
      header -server
      }


   startup.myfunkychickens.click {
      reverse_proxy * localhost:4000
      header Cache-Control no-store
      header -server
      header -etag
      header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
   }

   simon.myfunkychickens.click {
      reverse_proxy * localhost:3000
      header Cache-Control no-store
      header -server
      header -etag
      header Access-Control-Allow-Origin *
   }
   ```

1. Save the file and exit VI (`:wq`)

1. Restart Caddy so that your changes take effect. Note that since this requires you nto use `sudo` to elevate your user to have the rights to restart the gateway.

   ```sh
   sudo service caddy restart
   ```

If you open your browser and navigate to your domain name you will now see that the browser is displaying a lock icon, using HTTPS, and your certificate has been automatically requested by Caddy and issued by Let's Encrypt.

# HTML structure elements

The two major purposes of HTML is to provide structure and content to your web application. Some of the common HTML structural elements include `body`, `header`, `footer`, `main`, `section` `aside`, `p`, `table`, `ol/ul`, `div`, and `span`. We demonstrate the use of each element with the following HTML document. It starts with the top level content `body`. The body has three children, a `header`, `main`, and `footer`. Each of the body children then contains other structural content.

The `header` contains a `p`aragraph with a `span`, and a `nav`igation containing multiple `div`isions of sub-content.

The `main` contains multiple `section`s that contain either an unordered list (`ul`) or a `table`. Main also contains an `aside` for content that does not fit the content flow of the sections.

The `footer` has a content division with a single span.

```html
<body>
  <p>Body</p>
  <header>
    <p>Header - <span>Span</span></p>
    <nav>
      Navigation
      <div>Div</div>
      <div>Div</div>
    </nav>
  </header>

  <main>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <ul>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
        <li>List</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>Section</p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
          <th>Table</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
          <td>table</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </section>
    <aside>
      <p>Aside</p>
    </aside>
  </main>

  <footer>
    <div>Footer - <span>Span</span></div>
  </footer>
</body>
```

If we rendered this HTML, and added just a bit of styling, so we can see how they related to each other, we would see the following.

![HTML structure](htmlStructure.jpg)

Properly representing the page structure using the elements is important not only so it makes logical sense to a programmer, but also so that automated tools like search indexing crawlers and accessibility screen readers can correctly interpret the document.

## Block and inline

There is a distinction between structure elements that are block vs inline. A block element is meant to be a distinct block in the flow of the content structure. An inline element is meant to be inline with the content flow of a block element. In other words, inline elements do not disrupt the flow of a block element's content. For example, the block element `div` (division) could have an inline element `b` in order to bring attention to a portion of its sub-text. Likewise a `p` (paragraph) element could have a `span` to mark the paragraph's sub-text as a person's name.

```html
<div>He said <b>don't</b> cross the beams.</div>

<p>Authors such as <span>ee cummings</span> often used unconventional structure.</p>
```


# HTML input elements

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Input element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input)

From the very early days of HTML it contained elements for accepting the input of user data. These elements include the following:

| Element    | Meaning                          | Example                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `form`     | Input container and submission   | `<form action="form.html" method="post">`      |
| `fieldset` | Labeled input grouping           | `<fieldset> ... </fieldset>`                   |
| `input`    | Multiple types of user input     | `<input type="" />`                            |
| `select`   | Selection dropdown               | `<select><option>1</option></select>`          |
| `optgroup` | Grouped selection dropdown       | `<optgroup><option>1</option></optgroup>`      |
| `option`   | Selection option                 | `<option selected>option2</option>`            |
| `textarea` | Multiline text input             | `<textarea></textarea>`                        |
| `label`    | Individual input label           | `<label for="range">Range: </label>`           |
| `output`   | Output of input                  | `<output for="range">0</output>`               |
| `meter`    | Display value with a known range | `<meter min="0" max="100" value="50"></meter>` |

## Form element

The main purpose of the `form` element is to submit the values of the inputs it contains. Before JavaScript was introduced the `form` container element was essential because it was the only way for the browser to send the input data to a web server as part of a request to process the input and generate a new web page displaying the result of the input. With JavaScript we have much more control over input data and what is done with it. For example, in a single page application the JavaScript will dynamically rebuild the HTML elements to reflect the results of the user interaction. With this ability the data may not even be sent to the server. This greatly reduces the necessity of the `form` element, but it is often still used simply as a container. Just remember that you are not required to have a form element to use input elements.

Here is an example of a simple form that submits the value of a `textarea` element.

```html
<form action="submission.html" method="post">
  <label for="ta">TextArea: </label>
  <textarea id="ta" name="ta-id">
Some text
  </textarea>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

Pressing the submit button sends the following data to the web server. The browser generates the data by combining the textarea's `name` attribute with the current value of the textarea.

```
ta-id=Some+text
```

## Input element

The input element represents many different input types. You set the type of input with the `type` attribute. There are several different types to choose from. This includes different flavors of textual, numeric, date, and color inputs.

| Type           | Meaning                           |
| -------------- | --------------------------------- |
| text           | Single line textual value         |
| password       | Obscured password                 |
| email          | Email address                     |
| tel            | Telephone number                  |
| url            | URL address                       |
| number         | Numerical value                   |
| checkbox       | Inclusive selection               |
| radio          | Exclusive selection               |
| range          | Range limited number              |
| date           | Year, month, day                  |
| datetime-local | Date and time                     |
| month          | Year, month                       |
| week           | Week of year                      |
| color          | Color                             |
| file           | Local file                        |
| submit         | button to trigger form submission |

In order to create an input you specify the desired `type` attribute along with any other attribute associated with that specific input. Here is an example of a checked radio button and its associated label.

```html
<label for="checkbox1">Check me</label> <input type="checkbox" name="varCheckbox" value="checkbox1" checked />
```

Most input elements share some common attributes. These include the following.

| Attribute | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the input. This is submitted as the name of the input if used in a form |
| disabled  | Disables the ability for the user to interact with the input                        |
| value     | The initial value of the input                                                      |
| required  | Signifies that a value is required in order to be valid                             |

The following shows what the inputs look like when rendered. Don't worry about how clunky they look right out of the box. We will fix that when we start styling things with CSS.

![HTML Input](htmlInput.jpg)

## Validating input

Several of the input elements have validation built into them. This means that they will not accept a value that is not for example, a number, a URL, outside of a range, or an email address. You can also specify the `required` attribute on an input element to mark it as requiring a value before it can be submitted. The `pattern` attribute exists on `text`, `search`, `url`, `tel`, `email`, and `password` inputs. When present, the pattern attribute provides a regular expression that must match for the input to be considered as valid.

You should also have validation built into your JavaScript that checks input data to ensure everything is valid before it is submitted. All of the input elements support functions for determining their validation state. Additionally, there are CSS style selectors for visualizing the validity of the input. In order to have a good user experience, it is critical that you provide sufficient user feedback early in the input process. A good design will give feedback as, or before, the user begins to input. A poor design will keep the user guessing as to why the data is not being accepted, or even if it was accepted.



# HTML media elements

The HTML elements that represent media include `img`, `audio`, `video`, `svg`, and `canvas`. The `img`, `audio`, and `video` elements are all simple references to an external file, but `svg` and `canvas` both contain the code to render a visual image that can even be animated.

## External media

The media tags that reference external media all take a URL as an attribute. The path represented by the URL can either be a relative path or full path. A full path includes the protocol, domain name, and path to the file.

```html
https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg
```

A relative path references a file that is served from the same location as the HTML page rendering the element. You want to make the path as relative as possible so that you can move your code around without having to actually adjust all of the external page references. For example, if your HTML page is located in a directory with a subdirectory named `images` that contains a file named `photo.jpg` you would use a relative path as follows.

```html
images/photo.jpg
```

### Image

To include an image in your content you use the `img` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source image.
In order to support accessibility, you should also include an `alt` attribute that describes the image. A full img element would look like the following.

```html
<img alt="mountain landscape" src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/164170/pexels-photo-164170.jpeg" />
```

### Audio

To include an audio file in your content you use the `audio` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source audio file. You can include the `controls` attribute if you want the user to be able to control the audio playback. If you do not display the controls then there is no visual representation of the audio in the rendered page. The `autoplay` attribute starts the audio playing as soon as the audio file is loaded, and the `loop` attribute keeps it playing over and over.

⚠ Note that automatically playing audio is strongly discouraged unless you provide a way for the user to opt-in to that behavior.

```html
<audio controls src="testAudio.mp3"></audio>
```

### Video

To include a video in your content you use the `video` element and specify the `src` attribute with the URL to the source video. Like the audio element you can include the `controls` or `autoplay` attributes.

⚠ Note that you may need to include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute if you are requesting files from a different domain than the one serving your content.

```html
<video controls width="300" crossorigin="anonymous">
  <source src="https://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/gtv-videos-bucket/sample/BigBuckBunny.mp4" />
</video>
```

## Internal media

The internal media elements `svg` and `canvas` allow you to actually create images directly within your HTML.

### Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG)

SVG is an extremely powerful and widely supported way to render graphics inline in your HTML. An example SVG graphic that draws a black border and a red circle looks like this:

```html
<svg viewBox="0 0 300 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" stroke="red" fill="red" style="border: 1px solid #000000">
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="50" />
</svg>
```

When combined with JavaScript and CSS you can produce some amazing visualizations. Checkout this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/mdKjMLY) for an example.

Consult the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG) if you are interested in learning more about SVG.

### Canvas

The `canvas` element was introduced to HTML in order to facilitate 2D drawing and animation. The HTML for the canvas element is fairly simple, but actually drawing on the canvas requires JavaScript support. Here again, is our simple red dot example.

```html
<canvas id="canvasDemo" width="300" height="200" style="border: 1px solid #000000"></canvas>
<script>
  const ctx = document.getElementById('canvasDemo').getContext('2d');
  ctx.beginPath();
  ctx.arc(150, 100, 50, 0, 2 * Math.PI);
  ctx.fillStyle = 'red';
  ctx.strokeStyle = 'red';
  ctx.fill();
  ctx.stroke();
</script>
```

# CSS Declarations

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN reference section on properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)

CSS rule declarations specify a property and value to assign when the rule selector matches one or more elements. There are legions of possible properties defined for modifying the style of an HTML document. For our purposes we will discuss just a few of the more commonly used ones so that you can get a feel for wide variety of functionality they represent.

| Property           | Value                              | Example             | Discussion                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| background-color   | color                              | `red`               | Fill the background color                                                      |
| border             | color width style                  | `#fad solid medium` | Sets the border using shorthand where any or all of the values may be provided |
| border-radius      | unit                               | `50%`               | The size of the border radius                                                  |
| box-shadow         | x-offset y-offset blu-radius color | `2px 2px 2px gray`  | Creates a shadow                                                               |
| columns            | number                             | `3`                 | Number of textual columns                                                      |
| column-rule        | color width style                  | `solid thin black`  | Sets the border used between columns using border shorthand                    |
| color              | color                              | `rgb(128, 0, 0)`    | Sets the text color                                                            |
| cursor             | type                               | `grab`              | Sets the cursor to display when hovering over the element                      |
| display            | type                               | `none`              | Defines how to display the element and its children                            |
| filter             | filter-function                    | `grayscale(30%)`    | Applies a visual filter                                                        |

## Units

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Values and units](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units)

You can use a variety of units when defining the size of a CSS property. For example, the width of an element can be defined using absolute units such as the number of pixels (`px`) or inches (`in`). You can also use relative units such as a percentage of the parent element (`50%`), a percentage of a minimum viewport dimension (`25vmin`), or a multiplier of the size of the letter m (`1.5rem`) as defined by the root element.

```css
p {
  width: 25%;
  height: 30vh;
}
```

Here is a list of the most commonly used units. All of the units are prefixed with a number when used as a property value.

| Unit | Description                                                      |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| px   | The number of pixels                                             |
| pt   | The number of points (1/72 of an inch)                           |
| in   | The number of inches                                             |
| cm   | The number of centimeters                                        |
| %    | A percentage of the parent element                               |
| em   | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the parent's font |
| rem  | A multiplier of the width of the letter `m` in the root's font   |
| ex   | A multiplier of the height of the element's font                 |
| vw   | A percentage of the viewport's width                             |
| vh   | A percentage of the viewport's height                            |
| vmin | A percentage of the viewport's smaller dimension                 |
| vmax | A percentage of the viewport's larger dimension                  |

## Color

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Applying color](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Colors/Applying_color)

CSS defines multiple ways to describe color, ranging from representations familiar to programmers and ones familiar to layout designers and artists.

| Method       | Example                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| keyword      | `red`                     | A set of predefined colors (e.g. white, cornflowerblue, darkslateblue)                                                                                                                                            |
| RGB hex      | `#00FFAA22` or `#0FA2`    | Red, green, and blue as a hexadecimal number, with an optional alpha opacity                                                                                                                                      |
| RGB function | `rgb(128, 255, 128, 0.5)` | Red, green, and blue as a percentage or number between 0 and 255, with an optional alpha opacity percentage                                                                                                       |
| HSL          | `hsl(180, 30%, 90%, 0.5)` | Hue, saturation, and light, with an optional opacity percentage. Hue is the position on the 365 degree color wheel (red is 0 and 255). Saturation is how gray the color is, and light is how bright the color is. |

## Experiment

⚠ This [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKrgKQ) demonstrates the use of many of the above declarations. Take some time to experiment with it. Make sure you try modifying different selectors and declarations. Try different unit representations.


# CSS Selectors

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN CSS selectors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Selectors)

The first step in understanding CSS is mastering how to select the elements that a CSS rule applies to. The CSS rule selector can take many forms. In order to explain the most common selectors we need some demonstration HTML. Let's image a simple document describing the departments in a university. In our case we have a physics and a chemistry department. The information provided is very sparse, but the structure provided by the HTML is enough to work with.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Departments</h1>
  <p>welcome message</p>
  <section id="physics">
    <h2>Physics</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
  <section id="chemistry">
    <h2>Chemistry</h2>
    <p class="introduction">Introduction</p>
    <p>Text</p>
    <p class="summary">Summary</p>
  </section>
</body>
```

By default every browser defines a base set of styles that it applies to all HTML. This varies slightly from browser to browser, but for the most part our document would render like this using the base browser styles.

![CSS selectors base](cssSelectorBase.jpg)

We would like to style our document so that it looks like this when we are done.

![CSS selectors final](cssSelectorFinal.jpg)

## Element type selector

To start things off, we want to make all elements in the document use a sans-serif font. We can do this by using an element name selector. By selecting the `body` element we will cascade our declaration down to all the children of the body, which is the whole document.

```css
body {
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

Note that we could also use the wildcard element name selector (`*`) to select all elements, but for our needs the `body` element will work just fine.

We can also use element name selectors to give a bottom border to the top level heading (`h1`), as well as modify the section elements to pop out with a gray background and some white space in the padding and margins.

```css
h1 {
  border-bottom: thin black solid;
}

section {
  background: #eeeeee;
  padding: 0.25em;
  margin-bottom: 0.5em;
}
```

## Combinators

Next we want to change the color of the second level headings (`h2`), but we only want to do that within the sections for each department. To make that happen we can provide a `descendant combinator` that is defined with a space delimited list of values where each item in the list is a descendant of the previous item. So our selector would be all `h2` elements that are descendants of `section` elements.

```css
section h2 {
  color: #004400;
}
```

There are other types of combinators that you can use. These include the following.

| Combinator       | Meaning                    | Example        | Description                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Descendant       | A list of descendants      | `body section` | Any section that is a descendant of a body |
| Child            | A list of direct children  | `section > p`  | Any p that is a direct child of a section  |
| General sibling  | A list of siblings         | `p ~ div`      | Any p that has a div sibling               |
| Adjacent sibling | A list of adjacent sibling | `p + div`      | Any p that has an adjacent div sibling     |

We can use the general sibling combinator to increase the whitespace padding on the left of paragraphs that are siblings of a level two heading.

```css
h2 ~ p {
  padding-left: 0.5em;
}
```

## Class selector

The next selector we will use is the class selector. Remember that any element can have zero or more classifications applied to it. For example, our document has a class of `introduction` applied to the first paragraph, and a class of `summary` applied to the final paragraph of each section. If we want to bold the summary paragraphs we would supply the class name summary prefixed with a period (`.summary`).

```css
.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

You can also combine the element name and class selectors to select all paragraphs with a class of summary.

```css
p.summary {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

## ID selector

ID selectors reference the ID of an element. All IDs should be unique within an HTML document and so this select targets a specific element. To use the ID selector you prefix the ID with the hash symbol (`#`). We would like to showcase our physics department by putting a thin purple border along the left side of the physics section.

```css
#physics {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```

## Attribute selector

Attribute selectors allow you to select elements based upon their attributes. You use an attribute selector to select any element with a given attribute (`a[href]`). You can also specify a required value for an attribute (`a[href="./fish.png"]`) in order for the selector to match. Attribute selectors also support wildcards such as the ability to select attribute values containing specific text (`p[href*="https://"]).

```css
p[class='summary'] {
  color: red;
}
```

For a full description of attribute selections refer to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Attribute_selectors).

## Pseudo selector

CSS also defines a significant list of pseudo selectors which select based on positional relationships, mouse interactions, hyperlink visitation states, and attributes. We will give just one example. Suppose we want our purple highlight bar to appear only when the mouse hovers over the text. To accomplish this we can change our ID selector to select whenever a section is hovered over.

```css
section:hover {
  border-left: solid 1em purple;
}
```

You can find out more about pseudo selectors on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes).

# Responsive design

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Responsive design](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design)

Modern web applications are expected to run well on a large variety of computing devices. This includes everything from desktops, to mobile phones, to shopping kiosks, to car dashboards. This ability to reconfigure the interface so the application accommodates and takes advantage of the screen's size and orientation is called `responsive design`.

Much of HTML and CSS is already fluid due to the fact that it responds to the browser window being resized. For example a paragraph element will resize when the browser window is resized. However, the following features can completely change the layout of the application based on the device's size and orientation.

## Display

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Display](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display)

The CSS display property allows you to change how an HTML element is displayed by the browser. The common options for the display property include the following.

| Value  | Meaning                                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| none   | Don't display this element. The element still exists, but the browser will not render it.                                    |
| block  | Display this element with a width that fills its parent element. A `p` or `div` element has block display by default.        |
| inline | Display this element with a width that is only as big as its content. A `b` or `span` element has inline display by default. |
| flex   | Display this element's children in a flexible orientation.                                                                   |
| grid   | Display this element's children in a grid orientation.                                                                       |

We can demonstrate the different CSS display property values with the following HTML that contains a bunch of `div` elements. By default `div` elements have a display property value of `block`.

```html
<div class="none">None</div>
<div class="block">Block</div>
<div class="inline">Inline1</div>
<div class="inline">Inline2</div>
<div class="flex">
  <div>FlexA</div>
  <div>FlexB</div>
  <div>FlexC</div>
  <div>FlexD</div>
</div>
<div class="grid">
  <div>GridA</div>
  <div>GridB</div>
  <div>GridC</div>
  <div>GridD</div>
</div>
```

With the default of `block` this HTML would render like this.

![CSS default div display](cssDisplayDefault.jpg)

If we modify the display property associated with each element with the following CSS, then we get a totally different rendering.

```css
.none {
  display: none;
}

.block {
  display: block;
}

.inline {
  display: inline;
}

.flex {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}

.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
}
```

![CSS display](cssDisplay.jpg)

You can experiment with different display property values with this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/RwBOPjv).

## Viewport meta tag

When smart mobile devices started gaining popularity they began to be used to view websites. However, the websites were optimized for desktop displays and not little tiny mobile screens. To solve this mobile browsers automatically started scaling the website so that it looked better on a small screen. Unfortunately, as web applications started being responsive to the screen size, the mobile browser's scaling got in the way. The solution is to include a meta tag in the `head` element of all your HTML pages. This tells the browser to not scale the page.

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1" />
```

## Float

The float css property moves an element to the left or right of its container element and allows inline elements to wrap around it. For example, if we had an `aside` element followed by a large paragraph of text, we could create the following CSS rule in order to cause the text to wrap around the aside.

```css
aside {
  float: right;
  padding: 3em;
  margin: 0.5em;
  border: black solid thin;
}
```

![CSS float](cssFloat.gif)

When the browser resizes, the text will flow around the floating element. You can use this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/MWBRWPP) to experiment with `float`. Try changing the descriptor value to `none` or `left` and see what happens.

## Media queries

One of the main CSS features for creating responsive applications is the `@media` selector. This selector dynamically detects the size and orientation of the device and applies CSS rules to represent the structure of the HTML in a way that accommodates the change.

We can use the `@media` selector to tell us which side of the screen (technically the viewport) is the longest. A media query takes one or more predicates separated by boolean operators. In our case we simply want to know if the screen is oriented in portrait mode (short side on top) or not. If it is then we transform all of our div elements by rotating them 270 degrees.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  div {
    transform: rotate(270deg);
  }
}
```

We can demonstrate the result of applying the media selector by using the browser's debugger and switching into phone and responsive mode. You can also use this [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/rNKZOva) and play with it yourself by simply resizing the browser's window.

![CSS Media orientation](cssMediaOrientation.gif)

You can also use media queries to make entire pieces of your application disappear, or move to a different location. For example, if we had an aside that was helpful when the screen is wide, but took up too much room when the screen got narrow, we could use the following media query to make it disappear.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  aside {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

![CSS Media orientation](cssMediaDisappear.gif)

Here is the [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/NWzLGmJ) for this example.

## Grid and Flexbox

The final two responsive technologies that we want to discuss are Grid and Flexbox. These are both CSS display modes that automatically respond to screen sizes to position and resize their child elements. We will discuss each of these in detail in the following instruction.






# CSS Grid

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Grid_Layout)
- [Grid by example](https://gridbyexample.com/)

The `grid` display layout is useful when you want to display a group of child elements in a responsive grid. We start with a container element that has a bunch of child elements.

```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
  <div class="card"></div>
</div>
```

We turn this into a responsive grid by including a CSS `display` property with the value of `grid` on the container element. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a grid flow. The `grid-template-columns` property specifies the layout of the grid columns. We set this to repeatedly define each column to auto-fill the parent element's width with children that are resized to a minimum of 300 pixels and a maximum of one equal fractional unit (`1fr`) of the parents total width. A fractional unit is dynamically computed by splitting up the parent element's width into equal parts. Next, we fix the height of the rows to be exactly 300 pixels by specifying the `gird-auto-rows` property. Finally, we finish off the grid configuration by setting the `grid-gap` property to have a gap of at least 1 em between each grid item.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  grid-auto-rows: 300px;
  grid-gap: 1em;
}
```

Here is what the finished product looks like.

![CSS grid](cssGrid.gif)

You can experiment with the source on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/GRGXoWP).




# CSS Flexbox

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
- [CSS Tricks Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
- [Flexbox Froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/)

The `flex` display layout is useful when you want to partition your application into areas that responsively move around as the window resizes or the orientation changes. In order to demonstrate the power of flex we will build an application that has a header, footer, and a main content area that is split into two sections, with controls of the left and content on the right.

So we can visualize our design by quickly sketching it out.

![CSS App mock](cssAppMock.jpg)

Next we build our structural HTML to match our design.

```html
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>CSS flex &amp; media query</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <section>
      <h2>Controls</h2>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Content</h2>
    </section>
  </main>
  <footer>
    <h2>Footer</h2>
  </footer>
</body>
```

Now we can use Flexbox to make it all come alive. We make the body element into a responsive flexbox by including the CSS `display` property with the value of `flex`. This tells the browser that all of the children of this element are to be displayed in a flex flow. We want our top level flexbox children to be column oriented and so we add the `flex-direction` property with a value of `column`. We then add some simple other declarations to zero out the margin and fill the entire viewport with our application frame.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
}
```

To get the division of space for the flexbox children correct we add the following flex properties to each of the children.

- **header** - `flex: 0 80px` - Zero means it will not grow and 80px means it has a starting basis height of 80 pixels. This creates a fixed size box.
- **footer** - `flex: 0 30px` - Like the header it will not grow and has a height of 30 pixels.
- **main** - `flex: 1` - One means it will get one fractional unit of growth, and since it is the only child with a non-zero growth value, it will get all the remaining space. Main also gets some additional properties because we want it to also be a flexbox container for the controls and content area. So we set its display to be `flex` and specify the `flex-direction` to be row so that the children are oriented side by side.

```css
header {
  flex: 0 80px;
  background: hsl(223, 57%, 38%);
}

footer {
  flex: 0 30px;
  background: hsl(180, 10%, 10%);
}

main {
  flex: 1;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
}
```

Now we just need to add CSS to the control and content areas represented by the two child section elements. We want the controls to have 25% of the space and the content to have the remaining. So we set the `flex` property value to 1 and 3 respectively. That means that the controls get one unit of space and the content gets three units of space. No matter how we resize things this ratio will responsively remain.

```css
section:nth-child(1) {
  flex: 1;
  background-color: hsl(180, 10%, 80%);
}
section:nth-child(2) {
  flex: 3;
  background-color: white;
}
```

## Media Query

That completes our original design, but we also want to handle small screen sizes. To do this, we add some media queries that drop the header and footer if the viewport gets too short, and orient the main sections as rows if it gets too narrow.

To support the narrow screen (portrait mode), we include a media query that detects when we are in portrait orientation and sets the `flex-direction` of the main element to be column instead of row. This causes the children to be stacked on top of each other instead of side by side.

To handle making our header and footer disappear when the screen is to short to display them, we use a media query that triggers when our viewport height has a maximum value of 700 pixels. When that is true we change the `display` property for both the header and the footer to `none` so that they will be hidden. When that happens the main element becomes the only child and since it has a flex value of 1, it takes over everything.

```css
@media (orientation: portrait) {
  main {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}

@media (max-height: 700px) {
  header {
    display: none;
  }
  footer {
    display: none;
  }
}
```

Here is what the finished application looks like.

# JavaScript console

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN JavaScript Console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console)

The JavaScript console object provides interaction with the JavaScript runtime's debugger console. This usage of console should not be confused with your operating system's console (AKA terminal or command line). The console object provides functionality for outputting the value of text and objects, running timers, and counting iterations. These are useful debugging tools when you can actually execute your code in an interactive debugger (such as VS Code).

## Log

The basic usage of the console object is to output a log message.

```js
console.log('hello');
// OUTPUT: hello
```

You can create formatted messages in the log parameter.

```js
console.log('hello %s', 'world');
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

You can even specify CSS declarations in order to style the log output.

```js
console.log('%c JavaScript Demo', 'font-size:1.5em; color:green;');
// OUTPUT: JavaScript Demo //in large green text
```

## Timers

If you are trying to see how long a piece of code is running you can wrap it with `time` and `timeEnd` calls and it will output the duration between the `time` and `timeEnd` calls.

```js
console.time('demo time');
// ... some code that takes a long time.
console.timeEnd('demo time');
// OUTPUT: demo time: 9762.74 ms
```

## Count

To see how many times a block of code is called you can use the `count` function.

```js
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 1
console.count('a');
// OUTPUT: a: 2
console.count('b');
// OUTPUT: b: 1
```

# Adding JavaScript to HTML

You can insert JavaScript into HTML either by directly including it in the HTML within the content of a `<script>` element, or by using the `src` attribute of the script element to reference an external JavaScript file.

**index.js**

```js
function sayHello() {
  console.log('hello');
}
```

**index.html**

```html
<head>
  <script src="javascript.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <button onclick="sayHello()">Say Hello</button>
  <button onclick="sayGoodbye()">Say Goodbye</button>
  <script>
    function sayGoodbye() {
      alert('Goodbye');
    }
  </script>
</body>
```

Notice that we call the `sayHello` and `sayGoodbye` JavaScript functions from the HTML in the `onclick` attribute of the button element. Special attributes like `onclick` automatically create event listeners for different DOM events that call the code contained in the attribute's value. The code specified by the attribute value can be a simple call to a function or any JavaScript code.

```html
<button onclick="let i=1;i++;console.log(i)">press me</button>
<!-- OUTPUT: 2 -->
```


# JavaScript type and construct

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Data types and structures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Data_structures)

## Declaring variables

Variables are declared using either the `let` or `const` keyword. `let` allows you to change the value of the variable while `const` will cause an error if you attempt to change it.

```js
let x = 1;

const y = 2;
```

⚠ Originally JavaScript used the keyword `var` to define variables. This has been deprecated because they cause hard-to-detect errors in code related to the scope of the variable. You should avoid `var` and always declare your variables either with `let` or `const`.

## Type

JavaScript defines several primitive types.

| Type        | Meaning                                                    |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Null`      | The type of a variable that has not been assigned a value. |
| `Undefined` | The type of a variable that has not been defined.          |
| `Boolean`   | true or false.                                             |
| `Number`    | A 64-bit signed number.                                    |
| `BigInt`    | A number of arbitrary magnitude.                           |
| `String`    | A textual sequence of characters.                          |
| `Symbol`    | A unique value.                                            |

Of these types Boolean, Number, and String are the types commonly thought of when creating variables. However, variables may commonly refer to the Null or Undefined primitive. Because JavaScript does not enforce the declaration of a variable before you use it, it is entirely possible for a variable to have the type of Undefined.

In addition to the above primitives, JavaScript defines several object types. Some of the more commonly used objects include the following:

| Type       | Use                                                                                    | Example                  |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `Object`   | A collection of properties represented by name-value pairs. Values can be of any type. | `{a:3, b:'fish'}`        |
| `Function` | An object that has the ability to be called.                                           | `function a() {}`        |
| `Date`     | Calendar dates and times.                                                              | `new Date('1995-12-17')` |
| `Array`    | An ordered sequence of any type.                                                       | `[3, 'fish']`            |
| `Map`      | A collection of key-value pairs that support efficient lookups.                        | `new Map()`              |
| `JSON`     | A lightweight data-interchange format used to share information across programs.       | `{"a":3, "b":"fish"}`    |

## Common operators

When dealing with a number variable, JavaScript supports standard mathematical operators like `+` (add), `-` (subtract), `*` (multiply), `/` (divide), and `===` (equality). For string variables, JavaScript supports `+` (concatenation) and `===` (equality).

## Type conversions

JavaScript is a weakly typed language. That means that a variable always has a type, but the variable can change type when it is assigned a new value, or that types can be automatically converted based upon the context that they are used in. Sometimes the results of automatic conversions can be unexpected from programmers who are used to strongly typed languages. Consider the following examples.

```js
2 + '3';
// OUTPUT: '23'
2 * '3';
// OUTPUT: 6
[2] + [3];
// OUTPUT: '23'
true + null;
// OUTPUT: 1
true + undefined;
// OUTPUT: NaN
```

Getting unexpected results is especially common when dealing with the [equality](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness) operator.

```js
1 == '1';
// OUTPUT: true
null == undefined;
// OUTPUT: true
'' == false;
// OUTPUT: true
```

⚠ The unexpected results happen in JavaScript because it uses [complex rules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#strict_equality_using) for defining equality that depend upon the conversion of a type to a boolean value. You will sometimes hear this referred to as [falsy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Falsy) and [truthy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Truthy) evaluations. To remove this confusion, JavaScript introduced the strict equality (===) and inequality (!==) operators. The strict operators skip the type conversion when computing equality. This results in the following.

```js
1 === '1';
// OUTPUT: false
null === undefined;
// OUTPUT: false
'' === false;
// OUTPUT: false
```

Because strict equality is considered more intuitive, it is almost always preferred and should be used in your code.

Here is a fun example of JavaScript's type conversion. Execute the following in the browser's debugger console.

```js
('b' + 'a' + +'a' + 'a').toLowerCase();
```

## Conditionals

JavaScript supports many common programming language conditional constructs. This includes `if`, `else`, and `if else`. Here are some examples.

```js
if (a === 1) {
  //...
} else if (b === 2) {
  //...
} else {
  //...
}
```

You can also use the ternary operator. This provides a compact `if else` representation.

```js
a === 1 ? console.log(1) : console.log('not 1');
```

You can use boolean operations in the expression to create complex predicates. Common boolean operators include `&&` (and), `||` (or), and `!` (not).

```js
if (true && (!false || true)) {
  //...
}
```

### Loops

JavaScript supports many common programming language looping constructs. This includes `for`, `for in`, `for of`, `while`, `do while`, and `switch`. Here are some examples.

### for

Note the introduction of the common post increment operation (`i++`) for adding one to a number.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### do while

```js
let i = 0;
do {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 2);
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### while

```js
let i = 0;
while (i < 2) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

### for in

The `for in` statement iterates over an object's property names.

```js
const obj = { a: 1, b: 'fish' };
for (const name in obj) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: a
// OUTPUT: b
```

For arrays the object's name is the array index.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const name in arr) {
  console.log(name);
}
// OUTPUT: 0
// OUTPUT: 1
```

### for of

The `for of` statement iterates over an iterable's (Array, Map, Set, ...) property values.

```js
const arr = ['a', 'b'];
for (const val of arr) {
  console.log(val);
}
// OUTPUT: 'a'
// OUTPUT: 'b'
```

### Break and continue

All of the looping constructs demonstrated above allow for either a `break` or `continue` statement to abort or advance the loop.

```js
let i = 0;
while (true) {
  console.log(i);
  if (i === 0) {
    i++;
    continue;
  } else {
    break;
  }
}
// OUTPUT: 0 1
```

# Functions

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions)

In JavaScript functions are first class objects. That means that they can be assigned a name, passed as a parameter, returned as a result, and referenced from an object or array just like any other variable.

The basic syntax of a function begins with the `function` keyword followed by zero or more parameters and a body that may contain zero or more return statements. The return statement may return a single value. Note that there are no type declarations, as the type is always inferred by the assignment of the value to the parameter.

```js
function hello(who) {
  return 'hello ' + who;
}

console.log(hello('world'));
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

A function without a return value usually exists to produce some side effect like modifying a parameter or interacting with an external program. In the following example the side effect of the function is to output text to the debugger console.

```js
function hello(who) {
  who.count++;
  console.log('hello ' + who.name);
}

hello({ name: 'world', count: 0 });
// OUTPUT: hello world
```

## Function parameters

When a function is called, the caller may choose what parameters to provide. If a parameter is not provided then the value of the parameter is `undefined` when the function executes.

In addition to explicitly passing the value of a parameter to a function, the function can define a default value. This is done by assigning a value to the parameter in the function declaration.

```js
function labeler(value, title = 'title') {
  console.log(`${title}=${value}`);
}

labeler();
// OUTPUT: title=undefined

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: title=fish

labeler('fish', 'animal');
// OUTPUT: animal=fish
```

## Anonymous functions

Functions in JavaScript are commonly assigned to a variable so that they can be passed as a parameter to some other function or stored as an object property. To easily support this common use you can define a function anonymously and assign it to a variable.

```js
// Function that takes a function as a parameter
function doMath(operation, a, b) {
  return operation(a, b);
}

// Anonymous function assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

console.log(doMath(add, 5, 3));
// OUTPUT: 8

// Anonymous function assigned to a parameter
console.log(
  doMath(
    function (a, b) {
      return a - b;
    },
    5,
    3
  )
);
// OUTPUT: 2
```

## Creating, passing, and returning functions

Here are examples of assigning functions to variables, as well as using functions as parameters and return values.

```js
// Anonymous declaration of the function that is later assigned to a variable
const add = function (a, b) {
  return a + b;
};

// Function that logs as a side effect of its execution
function labeler(label, value) {
  console.log(label + '=' + value);
}

// Function that takes a function as a parameter and then executes the function as a side effect
function addAndLabel(labeler, label, adder, a, b) {
  labeler(label, adder(a, b));
}

// Passing a function to a function
addAndLabel(labeler, 'a+b', add, 1, 3);
// OUTPUT: a+b=4

// Function that returns a function
function labelMaker(label) {
  return function (value) {
    console.log(label + '=' + value);
  };
}

// Assign a function from the return value of the function
const nameLabeler = labelMaker('name');

// Calling the returned function
nameLabeler('value');
// OUTPUT: name=value
```

## Inner functions

Functions can also be declared inside other functions. This allows you to modularize your code without always exposing private details.

```js
function labeler(value) {
  function stringLabeler(value) {
    console.log('string=' + value);
  }
  function numberLabeler(value) {
    console.log('number=' + value);
  }

  if (typeof value == 'string') {
    stringLabeler(value);
  } else if (typeof value == 'number') {
    numberLabeler(value);
  }
}

labeler(5);
// OUTPUT: number=5

labeler('fish');
// OUTPUT: string=fish
```

# JavaScript arrow function

Because functions are first order objects in JavaScript they can be declared anywhere and passed as parameters. This results in code with lots of anonymous functions cluttering things up. To make the code more compact the `arrow` syntax was created. This syntax replaces the need for the `function` keyword with the symbols `=>` placed after the parameter declaration. The enclosing curly braces are also optional.

This is a function in arrow syntax that takes no parameters and always returns 3.

```js
() => 3;
```

The following two invocations of sort are equivalent.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3, 4];

// standard function syntax
a.sort(function (v1, v2) {
  return v1 - v2;
});

// arrow function syntax
a.sort((v1, v2) => v1 - v2);
```

Besides being compact, the `arrow` function syntax has some important semantic differences from the standard function syntax. This includes restrictions that arrow functions cannot be used for constructors or iterator generators.

## Return values

Arrow functions also have special rules for the `return` keyword. The return keyword is optional if no curly braces are provided for the function and it contains a single expression. In that case the result of the expression is automatically returned. If curly braces are provided then the arrow function behaves just like a standard function.

```js
() => 3;
// RETURNS: 3

() => {
  3;
};
// RETURNS: undefined

() => {
  return 3;
};
// RETURNS: 3
```

## This pointer

Next, arrow functions inherit the `this` pointer from the scope of where it is created. This makes what is known as a `closure`. A closure allows a function to continue referencing its creation scope, even after it has passed out of that scope. This can be tricky to wrap your head around, and we discuss it in detail when we later talk about JavaScript `scope`. For now consider the following example.

The function `makeClosure` returns an anonymous function using the arrow syntax. Notice that the `a` parameter is overridden, a new `b` variable is created, and both `a` and `b` are referenced in the arrow function. Because of that reference, they are both part of the closure for the returned function.

```js
function makeClosure(a) {
  a = 'a2';
  const b = 'b2';
  return () => [a, b];
}
```

Next, we declare the variables `a` and `b` at the top level scope, and call `makeClosure` with `a`.

```js
const a = 'a';
const b = 'b';

const closure = makeClosure(a);
```

Now, when we call `closure` function it will output the values contained in scope where it was created instead of the current values of the variables.

```js
console.log(closure());
// OUTPUT: ['a2', 'b2']

console.log(a, b);
// OUTPUT: 'a' 'b'
```

Closures provide a valuable property when we do things like execute JavaScript within the scope of an HTML page, because it can remember the values of variables when the function was created instead of what they are when they are executed.

## Putting it all together

Now that you know how functions work in JavaScript, let's look at an example that demonstrates the use of functions, arrow functions, parameters, a function as a parameter (callback), closures, and browser event listeners. This is done by implementing a `debounce` function.

The point of a debounce function is to only execute a specified function once within a given time window. Any requests to execute the debounce function more frequently than this will case the time window to reset. This is important in cases where a user can trigger expensive events thousands of times per second. Without a debounce the performance of your application can greatly suffer.

The following code calls the browser's `window.addEventListener` function to add a callback function that is invoked whenever the user scrolls the browser's web page. The first parameter to `addEventListener` specifies that it wants to listen for `scroll` events. The second parameter provides the function to call when a scroll event happens. In this case we call a function named `debounce`.

The debounce function takes two parameters, the time window for executing the window function, and the window function to call within that limit. In this case we will execute the arrow function at most every 500 milliseconds.

```js
window.addEventListener(
  'scroll',
  debounce(500, () => {
    console.log('Executed an expensive calculation');
  })
);
```

The debounce function implements the execution of windowFunc within the restricted time window by creating a closure that contains the current timeout and returning a function that will reset the timeout every time it is called. The returned function is what the scroll event will actually call when the user scrolls the page. However, instead of directly executing the `windowFunc` it sets a timer based on the value of `windowMs`. If the debounce function is called again before the window times out then it resets the timeout.

```js
function debounce(windowMs, windowFunc) {
  let timeout;
  return function () {
    console.log('scroll event');
    clearTimeout(timeout);
    timeout = setTimeout(() => windowFunc(), windowMs);
  };
}
```

You can experiment with this in [CodePen](https://codepen.io/leesjensen/pen/XWxVBRx). In this example, the background color will change as long as the user is scrolling. When they stop the background reverts back to white.

# JavaScript array

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Array](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array)

JavaScript array objects represent a sequence of other objects and primitives. You can reference the members of the array using a zero based index. You can create an array with the Array constructor or using the array literal notation shown below.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(a[1]);
// OUTPUT: 2

console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 3
```

## Object functions

The Array object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the interesting ones.

| Function | Meaning                                                   | Example                       |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| push     | Add an item to the end of the array                       | `a.push(4)`                   |
| pop      | Remove an item from the end of the array                  | `x = a.pop()`                 |
| slice    | Return a sub-array                                        | `a.slice(1,-1)`               |
| sort     | Run a function to sort an array in place                  | `a.sort((a,b) => b-a)`        |
| values   | Creates an iterator for use with a `for of` loop          | `for (i of a.values()) {...}` |
| find     | Find the first item satisfied by a test function          | `a.find(i => i < 2)`          |
| forEach  | Run a function on each array item                         | `a.forEach(console.log)`      |
| reduce   | Run a function to reduce each array item to a single item | `a.reduce((a, c) => a + c)`   |
| map      | Run a function to map an array to a new array             | `a.map(i => i+i)`             |
| filter   | Run a function to remove items                            | `a.filter(i => i%2)`          |
| every    | Run a function to test if all items match                 | `a.every(i => i < 3)`         |
| some     | Run a function to test if any items match                 | `a.some(i => 1 < 1)`          |

```js
const a = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a.map((i) => i + i));
// OUTPUT: [2,4,6]
console.log(a.reduce((v1, v2) => v1 + v2));
// OUTPUT: 6
console.log(a.sort((v1, v2) => v2 - v1));
// OUTPUT: [3,2,1]

a.push(4);
console.log(a.length);
// OUTPUT: 4
```

# JavaScript regular expressions

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions)

Regular expression support is built right into JavaScript. If you are not familiar with regular expressions, you can think of them as textual pattern matchers. You use a regular expression to find text in a string so that you can replace it, or simply to know that it exists.

You can create a regular expression using the class constructor or a regular expression literal.

```js
const objRegex = new RegExp('ab*', 'i');
const literalRegex = /ab*/i;
```

The `string` class has several functions that accept regular expressions. This includes `match`, `replace`, `search`, and `split`. For a quick test to see if there is a match you can use the regular expression object's `test` function.

```js
const petRegex = /(dog)|(cat)|(bird)/gim;
const text = 'Both cats and dogs are pets, but not rocks.';

text.match(petRegex);
// RETURNS: ['cat', 'dog']

text.replace(petRegex, 'animal');
// RETURNS: Both animals and animals are pets, but not rocks.

petRegex.test(text);
// RETURNS: true
```



# JavaScript rest and spread

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Rest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/rest_parameters)
- [MDN Spread](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax)

## Rest

Sometimes you want a function to take an unknown number of parameters. For example, if you wanted to write a function that checks to see if some number in a list is equal to a given number, you could write this using an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

const a = [1, 2, 3];
hasNumber(2, a);
// RETURNS: true
```

However sometimes you don't have an array to work with. In this case you could create one on the fly.

```js
function hasTwo(a, b, c) {
  return hasNumber(2, [a, b, c]);
}
```

But JavaScript provides the `rest` syntax to make this easier. Think of it as a parameter that contains the `rest` of the parameters. To turn the last parameter of any function into a `rest` parameter you prefix it with three periods. You can then call it with any number of parameters and they are all automatically combined into an array.

```js
function hasNumber(test, ...numbers) {
  return numbers.some((i) => i === test);
}

hasNumber(2, 1, 2, 3);
// RETURNS: true
```

Note that you can only make the last parameter a `rest` parameter. Otherwise JavaScript would not know which parameters to combine into the array.

Technically speaking, `rest` allows JavaScript to provide what is called variadic functions.

## Spread

Spread does the opposite of rest. It take an object that is iterable (e.g. array or string) and expands it into a function's parameters. Consider the following.

```js
function person(firstName, lastName) {
  return { first: firstName, last: lastName };
}

const p = person(...['Ryan', 'Dahl']);
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {first: 'Ryan', last: 'Dahl'}
```


# JavaScript exceptions

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN try...catch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/try...catch)

JavaScript supports exception handling using the `try catch` and `throw` syntax. An exception can be triggered whenever your code generates an exception using the `throw` keyword, or whenever an exception is generated by the JavaScript runtime, for example, when an undefined variable is used.

To catch a thrown exception, you wrap a code block with the `try` keyword, and follow the try block with a `catch` block. If within the try block, including any functions that block calls, an exception is thrown, then all of the code after the throw is ignored, the call stack is unwound, and the catch block is called.

In addition to a catch block, you can specify a `finally` block that is always called whenever the `try` block is exited regardless if an exception was ever thrown.

The basic syntax looks like the following.

```js
try {
  // normal execution code
} catch (err) {
  // exception handling code
} finally {
  // always called code
}
```

For example:

```js
function connectDatabase() {
  throw new Error('connection error');
}

try {
  connectDatabase();
  console.log('never executed');
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
} finally {
  console.log('always executed');
}

// OUTPUT: Error: connection error
//         always executed
```

⚠ When first using exception handling it is tempting to use it as way to handle normal flows of execution. For example, throwing a `file not found` exception when it is common for users to request nonexistent files. Throwing exceptions should only happen when something truly exceptional occurs. For example, a `file not found` exception when the file is required for your code to run, such as a required configuration file. Your code will be easier to debug, and your logs more meaningful if you restrict exceptions to truly exceptional situations.

## Fallbacks

The fallback pattern is commonly implemented using exception handling. To implement the fallback pattern you put the normal feature path in a try block and then provide a fallback implementation in the catch block. For example, normally you would get the high scores for a game by making a network request, but if the network is not available then a locally cached version of the last available scores is used. By providing a fallback, you can always return something, even if the desired feature is temporarily unavailable.

```js
function getScores() {
  try {
    const scores = scoringService.getScores();
    // store the scores so that we can use them later if the network is not available
    window.localStorage.setItem('scores', scores);
    return scores;
  } catch {
    return window.localStorage.getItem('scores');
  }
}
```

# JavaScript destructuring

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment)

Destructuring, not to be confused with destructing, is the process of pulling individual items out of an existing one, or removing structure. You can do this with either arrays or objects. This is helpful when you only care about a few items in the original structure.

An example of destructuring arrays looks like the following.

```js
const a = [1, 2, 4, 5];

// destructure the first two items from a, into the new variables b and c
const [b, c] = a;

console.log(b, c);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2
```

Note that even though it looks like you are declaring an array with the syntax on the left side of the expression, it is only specifying that you want to destructure those values out of the array.

You can also combine multiple items from the original object using rest syntax.

```js
const [b, c, ...others] = a;

console.log(b, c, others);
// OUTPUT: 1, 2, [4,5]
```

This works in a similar manner for objects, except with arrays, the assignment of the associated value was assumed by the positions in the two arrays. When destructuring objects, you explicitly specify the properties you want to pull from the source object.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a, c } = o;

console.log(a, c);
// OUTPUT 1, ['fish', 'cats']
```

You can also map the names to new variables instead of just using the original property names.

```js
const o = { a: 1, b: 'animals', c: ['fish', 'cats'] };

const { a: count, b: type } = o;

console.log(count, type);
// OUTPUT 1, animals
```

Default values may also be provided for missing ones.

```js
const { a, b = 22 } = {};
const [c = 44] = [];

console.log(a, b, c);
// OUTPUT: undefined, 22, 44
```

Note that all of the above examples created new constant variables, but you can also use destructuring to reassign existing variables.

```js
let a = 22;

[a] = [1, 2, 3];

console.log(a);
// OUTPUT: 1
```

# JavaScript object and classes

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Classes_in_JavaScript)

A JavaScript object represents a collection of name value pairs referred to as properties. The property name must be of type String or Symbol, but the value can be of any type. Objects also have common object-oriented functionality such as constructors, a `this` pointer, static properties and functions, and inheritance.

Objects can be created with the new operator. This causes the object's constructor to be called. Once declared you can add properties to the object by simply referencing the property name in an assignment. Any type of variable can be assigned to a property. This includes a sub-object, array, or function. The properties of an object can be referenced either with dot (`obj.prop`) or bracket notation (`obj['prop']`).

```js
const obj = new Object({a:3});
obj['b'] = 'fish';
obj.c = [1, 2, 3];
obj.hello = function () {
  console.log('hello');
};

console.log(obj);
// OUTPUT: {a: 3, b: 'fish', c: [1,2,3], hello: func}
```

The ability to dynamically modify an object is incredibly useful when manipulating data with an indeterminate structure.

⚠ Note the different uses of the term `object`. Object can refer to the standard JavaScript objects (e.g. `Promise, Map, Object, Function, Date, ...`), or it can refer specifically to the JavaScript Object object (i.e. `new Object()`), or it can refer to any JavaScript object you create (e.g. `{a:'a', b:2}` ). This overloaded usage can be a bit confusing.

## Object-literals

You can also declare a variable of object type with the `object-literal` syntax. This syntax allows you to provide the initial composition of the object.

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};
```

## Object functions

Object has several interesting static functions associated with it. Here are some of the commonly used ones.

| Function | Meaning                             |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| entries  | Returns an array of key value pairs |
| keys     | Returns an array of keys            |
| values   | Returns an array of values          |

```js
const obj = {
  a: 3,
  b: 'fish',
};

console.log(Object.entries(obj));
// OUTPUT: [['a', 3], ['b', 'fish']]
console.log(Object.keys(obj));
// OUTPUT: ['a', 'b']
console.log(Object.values(obj));
// OUTPUT: [3, 'fish']
```

## Constructor

Any function that returns an object is considered a `constructor` and can be invoked with the `new` operator.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
console.log(p);
// OUTPUT: {name: 'Eich'}
```

Because objects can have any type of property value you can create methods on the object as part of its encapsulation.

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    log: function () {
      console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
    },
  };
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

## This pointer

Notice in the last example the use of the keyword `this` when we referred to the name property (`this.name`). The meaning of `this` depends upon the scope of where it is used, but in the context of an object it refers to a pointer to the object. We will talk more about the `this` pointer in the instruction on scope.

## Classes

You can use classes to define objects. Using a class clarifies the intent to create a reusable component rather than a one-off object. Class declarations look similar to declaring an object, but classes have an explicit constructor and assumed function declarations. The person object from above would look like the following when converted to a class.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  log() {
    console.log('My name is ' + this.name);
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.log();
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich
```

You can make properties and functions of classes private by prefixing them with a `#`.

```js
class Person {
  #name;

  constructor(name) {
    this.#name = name;
  }
}

const p = new Person('Eich');
p.#name = 'Lie';
// OUTPUT: Uncaught SyntaxError: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

## Inheritance

Classes can be extended by using the `extends` keyword to define inheritance. Parameters that need to be passed to the parent class are delivered using the `super` function. Any functions defined on the child that have the same name as the parent override the parent's implementation. A parent's function can be explicitly accessed using the `super` keyword.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  print() {
    return 'My name is ' + this.name;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor(name, position) {
    super(name);
    this.position = position;
  }

  print() {
    return super.print() + '. I am a ' + this.position;
  }
}

const e = new Employee('Eich', 'programmer');
console.log(e.print());
// OUTPUT: My name is Eich. I am a programmer
```


# Scope

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Scope](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Scope)
- [MDN this](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this)
- [MDN Closures](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures)

Understanding JavaScript scope is essential for making your programs run as you expect. Scope is defined as the variables that are visible in the current context of execution. JavaScript has four different types of scope:

1. **Global** - Visible to all code
1. **Module** - Visible to all code running in a module
1. **Function** - Visible within a function
1. **Block** - Visible within a block of code delimited by curly braces

## Var

Initially JavaScript used the keyword `var` to declare a variable. The problem with var, unlike `const` or `let`, is that it ignores block scope. Variables declared with `var` are always logically hoisted to the top of the function. For example, the following code shows the same variable name being used within different enclosing scopes. However, because var ignores block scope the for loop is simply assigning a new value to `x` rather than declaring a new variable that has the same name.

```js
var x = 10;
console.log('start', x);

for (var x = 0; x < 1; x++) {
  console.log('middle', x);
}

console.log('end', x);

// OUTPUT: start 10
//         middle 0
//         end 1
```

⚠ There are few cases where it makes sense to use `var`. It is strongly suggested that you only use `const` and `let` unless you fully understand why you are using `var`.

## This

The keyword `this` represents a variable that points to an object that contains the context within the scope of the currently executing line of code. The `this` variable is automatically declared and you can reference `this` anywhere in a JavaScript program. Because the value of `this` depends upon the context in which it is referenced, there are three different context that this can refer to:

1. **Global** - When `this` is referenced outside a function or object it refers to the `globalThis` object. The globalThis object represents the context for runtime environment. For example, when running in a browser, globalThis refers to the browser's window object.
1. **Function** - When `this` is referenced in a function it refers to the object that owns the function. That is either an object you defined or globalThis if the function is defined outside of an object. Note that when running in JavaScript strict mode, a global function's this variable is undefined instead of globalThis.
1. **Object** - When `this` is referenced in an object it refers to the object.

```js
'use strict';

// global scope
console.log('global:', this);
console.log('globalThis:', globalThis);

// function scope for a global function
function globalFunc() {
  console.log('globalFunctionThis:', this);
}
globalFunc();

// object scope
class ScopeTest {
  constructor() {
    console.log('objectThis:', this);
  }

  // function scope for an object function
  objectFunc() {
    console.log('objectFunctionThis:', this);
  }
}

new ScopeTest().objectFunc();
```

Running the above code in a browser results in the following.

```
global: Window
globalThis: Window
globalFunctionThis: undefined
objectThis: ScopeTest
objectFunctionThis: ScopeTest
```

Note that if we were not using JavaScript strict mode then globalFunctionThis would refer to Window.

## Closure

A closure is defined as a function and its surrounding state. That means whatever variables are accessible when a function is created are available inside that function. This holds true even if you pass the function outside of the scope of its original creation.

Here is an example of a function that is created as part of an object. That means that function has access to the object's `this` pointer.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: function () {
    console.log(this.x);
  },
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

Arrow functions are a bit different because they inherit the `this` pointer of their creation context. So if we change our previous example to return an arrow function, then the `this` pointer at the time of creation will be globalThis.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  f: () => console.log(this.x),
};

obj.f();
// OUTPUT: global
```

However, if we make function in our object that **returns** an arrow function, then the `this` pointer will be the object's `this` pointer since that was the active context at the time the arrow function was created.

```js
globalThis.x = 'global';

const obj = {
  x: 'object',
  make: function () {
    return () => console.log(this.x);
  },
};

const f = obj.make();
f();
// OUTPUT: object
```

# JavaScript modules

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN JavaScript modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)

JavaScript modules allow for the partitioning and sharing of code. Initially JavaScript had no support for modules. Node.js, a server side JavaScript execution application, introduced the concept of modules in order to support the importing of packages of JavaScript from third party providers.

JavaScript got full module support with ES6, and they have become the standard module representation as [browser support](https://caniuse.com/es6-module-dynamic-import) for ES modules is now almost universal.

In order to differentiate between the two implementations, Node.js modules are called CommonJS modules, and JavaScript modules are called ES modules. For this discussion, we will focus only on ES modules.

Because modules create a file-based scope for the code they represent, you must explicitly `export` the objects from one file and then `import` them into another file. For example, here is a simple module that exports a function that displays an alert.

**alert.js**

```js
export function alertDisplay(msg) {
  alert(msg);
}
```

You can import the module's exported function into another module using the `import` keyword.

**main.js**

```js
import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';

alertDisplay('called from main.js');
```

## ES Modules in the browser

When you use ES modules in the browser via HTML script references, things get a little complicated. The key thing to understand is that modules can only be called from other modules. You cannot access JavaScript contained in a module from the global scope that your non-module JavaScript is executing in.

From your HTML, you can specify that you are using an ES module by including a `type` attribute with the value of `module` in the `script` element. You can then import and use other modules. This is shown in the example below.

**index.html**

```html
<script type="module">
  import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
  alertDisplay('module loaded');
</script>
```

If we want to use a module in the global scope that our HTML or other non-module JavaScript is executing in, then we must leak it into the global scope. We do this by either attaching an event handler or explicitly adding a function to the global window object. In the example below, we expose the `alertDisplay` imported module function by attaching it to the global JavaScript `window` object so that it can then be called from the button `onclick` handler. We also expose the module function by attaching a `keypress` event.

**index.html**

```html
<html>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import { alertDisplay } from './alert.js';
      window.btnClick = alertDisplay;

      document.body.addEventListener('keypress', function (event) {
        alertDisplay('Key pressed');
      });
    </script>
    <button onclick="btnClick('button clicked')">Press me</button>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, if the button is pushed or a key is pressed our ES module function will be called.

## Modules with web frameworks

Fortunately, when you use a web framework bundler, discussed in later instruction, to generate your web application distribution code, you usually don't have to worry about differentiating between global scope and ES module scope. The bundler will inject all the necessary syntax to connect your HTML to your modules. Historically, this was done by removing the modules and placing all of the JavaScript in a namespaced global partition. Now that ES Modules are supported on most browsers, the bundler will expose the ES module directly.

Because of the complex history of modules they can be a confusing topic, but it is well worth the time to understand how they work as they are a core piece of a web programmer's toolkit.




# Document Object Model

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Introduction to the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction)
- [W3C DOM specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/level-one-core.html) - This official specification is only for reference

The Document Object Model (DOM) is an object representation of the HTML elements that the browser uses to render the display. The browser also exposes the DOM to external code so that you can write programs that dynamically manipulate the HTML.

The browser provides access to the DOM through a global variable name `document` that points to the root element of the DOM. If you open the browser's debugger console window and type the variable name `document` you will see the DOM for the document the browser is currently rendering.

```html
> document

<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <p>text1 <span>text2</span></p>
    <p>text3</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

```css
p {
  color: red;
}
```

For everything in an HTML document there is a node in the DOM. This includes elements, attributes, text, comments, and whitespace. All of these nodes form a big tree, with the document node at the top.

## Accessing the DOM

Every element in an HTML document implements the DOM Element interface, which is derived from the DOM Node interface. The [DOM Element Interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element) provides the means for iterating child elements, accessing the parent element, and manipulating the element's attributes. From your JavaScript code, you can start with the `document` variable and walk through the every element in the tree.

```js
function displayElement(el) {
  console.log(el.tagName);
  for (const child of el.children) {
    displayElement(child);
  }
}

displayElement(document);
```

You can provide a CSS selector to the `querySelectorAll` function in order to select elements from the document. The `textContent` property contains all of the element's text. You can even access a textual representation of an element's HTML content with the `innerHTML` property.

```js
const listElements = document.querySelectorAll('p');
for (const el of listElements) {
  console.log(el.textContent);
}
```

## Modifying the DOM

The DOM supports the ability to insert, modify, or delete the elements in the DOM. To create a new element you first create the element on the DOM document. You then insert the new element into the DOM tree by appending it to an existing element in the tree.

```js
function insertChild(parentSelector, text) {
  const newChild = document.createElement('div');
  newChild.textContent = text;

  const parentElement = document.querySelector(parentSelector);
  parentElement.appendChild(newChild);
}

insertChild('#courses', 'new course');
```

To delete elements call the `removeChild` function on the parent element.

```js
function deleteElement(elementSelector) {
  const el = document.querySelector(elementSelector);
  el.parentElement.removeChild(el);
}

deleteElement('#courses div');
```

## Injecting HTML

The DOM also allows you to inject entire blocks of HTML into an element. The following code finds the first `div` element in the DOM and replaces all the HTML it contains.

```js
const el = document.querySelector('div');
el.innerHTML = '<div class="injected"><b>Hello</b>!</div>';
```

However, directly injecting HTML as a block of text is a common attack vector for hackers. If an untrusted party can inject JavaScript anywhere in your application then that JavaScript can represent itself as the current user of the application. The attacker can then make requests for sensitive data, monitor activity, and steal credentials. The example below shows how the img element can be used to launch an attack as soon as the page is loaded.

```html
<img src="bogus.png" onerror="console.log('All your base are belong to us')" />
```

If you are injecting HTML, make sure that it cannot be manipulated by a user. Common injection paths include HTML input controls, URL parameters, and HTTP headers. Either sanitize any HTML that contains variables, or simply use DOM manipulation functions instead of using `innerHTML`.

## Event Listeners

All DOM elements support the ability to attach a function that gets called when an event occurs on the element. These functions are called [event listeners](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener). Here is an example of an event listener that gets called when an element gets clicked.

```js
const submitDataEl = document.querySelector('#submitData');
submitDataEl.addEventListener('click', function (event) {
  console.log(event.type);
});
```

There are lots of possible events that you can add a listener to. This includes things like mouse, keyboard, scrolling, animation, video, audio, WebSocket, and clipboard events. You can see the full list on [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events). Here are a few of the more commonly used events.

| Event Category | Description           |
| -------------- | --------------------- |
| Clipboard      | Cut, copied, pasted   |
| Focus          | An element gets focus |
| Keyboard       | Keys are pressed      |
| Mouse          | Click events          |
| Text selection | When text is selected |

You can also add event listeners directly in the HTML. For example, here is a `onclick` handler that is attached to a button.

```html
<button onclick='alert("clicked")'>click me</button>
```


# Local storage

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN LocalStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)

The browser's `localStorage` API provides the ability to persistently store and retrieve data (i.e. scores, usernames, etc.,) on a user's browser across user sessions and HTML page renderings. For example, your frontend JavaScript code could store a user's name on one HTML page, and then retrieve the name later when a different HTML page is loaded. The user's name will also be available in local storage the next time the same browser is used to access the same website.

In addition to persisting application data between page renderings, `localStorage` is also used as a cache for when data cannot be obtained from the server. For example, your frontend JavaScript could store the last high scores obtained from the service, and then display those scores in the future if the service is not available.

## How to use LocalStorage

There are four main functions that can be used with localStorage.

| Function             | Meaning                                      |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| setItem(name, value) | Sets a named item's value into local storage |
| getItem(name)        | Gets a named item's value from local storage |
| removeItem(name)     | Removes a named item from local storage      |
| clear()              | Clears all items in local storage            |

A local storage value must be of type `string`, `number`, or `boolean`. If you want to store a JavaScript object or array, then you must first convert it to a JSON string with `JSON.stringify()` on insertion, and parse it back to JavaScript with `JSON.parse()` when retrieved.

## Example

Open your startup website and run the following code in the browser's dev tools console window.

```js
let user = 'Alice';

let myObject = {
  name: 'Bob',
  info: {
    favoriteClass: 'CS 260',
    likesCS: true,
  },
};

let myArray = [1, 'One', true];

localStorage.setItem('user', user);
localStorage.setItem('object', JSON.stringify(myObject));
localStorage.setItem('array', JSON.stringify(myArray));

console.log(localStorage.getItem('user'));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('object')));
console.log(JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('array')));
```

**Output**

```sh
Alice
{name: 'Bob', info: {favoriteClass: 'CS 260', likesCS: true}
[1, 'One', true]
```

Notice that you are able to see the round trip journey of the local storage values in the console output. If you want to see what values are currently set for your application, then open the `Application` tab of the dev tools and select `Storage > Local Storage` and then your domain name. With the dev tools you can add, view, update, and delete any local storage values.

# Promises

📖 **Deeper dive reading**:

- [MDN Using Promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises)
- [MDN Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)

JavaScript executes as a single threaded application. That means there is only ever one piece of code executing at the same time. However, the fact that it does not execute concurrently does not mean that it does not execute in parallel. You can asynchronously execute code with the use of a JavaScript `Promise`. Because the execution is asynchronous the promise object can be in one of three states at any given point in time.

1. **pending** - Currently running asynchronously
1. **fulfilled** - Completed successfully
1. **rejected** - Failed to complete

You create a promise by calling the Promise object constructor and passing it an executor function that runs the asynchronous operation. Executing asynchronously means that promise constructor may return before the promise executor function runs.

We can demonstrate asynchronous execution by using the standard JavaScript `setTimeout` function to create a delay in the execution of the code. The setTimeout function takes the number of milliseconds to wait and a function to call after that amount of time has expired. We call the delay function in a for loop in the promise executor and also a for loop outside the promise so that both code blocks are running in parallel.

```js
const delay = (msg, wait) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(msg, wait);
  }, 1000 * wait);
};

new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  // Code executing in the promise
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    delay('In promise', i);
  }
});

// Code executing after the promise
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  delay('After promise', i);
}

// OUTPUT:
//   In promise 0
//   After promise 0
//   In promise 1
//   After promise 1
//   In promise 2
//   After promise 2
```

## Resolving and rejecting

Now that we know how to use a promise to execute asynchronously, we need to be able to set the state to `fulfilled` when things complete correctly, or to `rejected` when an error happens. The promise executor function takes two functions as parameters, `resolve` and `reject`. Calling `resolve` sets the promise to the `fulfilled` state, and calling `reject` sets the promise to the `rejected` state.

Consider the following "coin toss" promise that waits ten seconds and then has a fifty percent chance of resolving or rejecting.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {
      resolve('success');
    } else {
      reject('error');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

If you log the coinToss promise object to the console immediately after calling the constructor, it will display that it is in the `pending` state.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

If you then wait ten seconds and the log the coinToss promise object again, the state will either show as `fulfilled` or `rejected` depending upon the way the coin landed.

```js
console.log(coinToss);
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>}
```

## Then, catch, finally

With the ability to asynchronously execute and set the resulting state, we now need a way to generically do something with the result of a promise after it resolves. This is done with functionality similar to exception handling. The promise object has three functions: `then`, `catch`, and `finally`. The `then` function is called if the promise is fulfilled, `catch` is called if the promise is `rejected`, and `finally` is always called after all the processing is completed.

We can rework our coinToss example and make it so 10 percent of the time the coin falls off the table and resolves to the rejected state. Otherwise the promise resolves to fulfilled with a result of either `heads` or `tails`.

```js
const coinToss = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
      resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
    } else {
      reject('fell off table');
    }
  }, 10000);
});
```

We then chain the `then`, `catch` and `finally` functions to the coinToss object in order to handle each of the possible results.

```js
coinToss
  .then((result) => console.log(`Coin toss result: ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.log(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log('Toss completed'));

// OUTPUT:
//    Coin toss result: tails
//    Toss completed
```

## The observer pattern

Promises are the standard way to do asynchronous processing in JavaScript, but they are not the only way. The `Observer` pattern, popularized by web programming frameworks such as `Angular`, use a model called `Observer`. The major difference between Observers and Promises is that Promises immediately begin to execute when the Promise is created, but Observers form a pipeline that you then pass an execution object into. This allows Observers to be reused, and the result of executing an Observable to be saved as a history of a particular execution.



# JavaScript Async/await

📖 **Deeper dive reading**: [MDN async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function)

JavaScript Promise objects are great for asynchronous execution, but as developers began to build large systems with promises they started wanting a more concise representation. This was provided with the introduction of the `async/await` syntax. The `await` keyword wraps the execution of a promise and removed the need to chain functions. The `await` expression will block until the promise state moves to `fulfilled`, or throws an exception if the state moves to `rejected`. For example, if we have a function that returns a coin toss promise.

```js
const coinToss = () => {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      if (Math.random() > 0.1) {
        resolve(Math.random() > 0.5 ? 'heads' : 'tails');
      } else {
        reject('fell off table');
      }
    }, 1000);
  });
};
```

We can create equivalent executions with either a promise `then/catch` chain, or an `await` with a `try/catch` block.

**then/catch chain version**

```js
coinToss()
  .then((result) => console.log(`Toss result ${result}`))
  .catch((err) => console.error(`Error: ${err}`))
  .finally(() => console.log(`Toss completed`));
```

**async, try/catch version**

```js
try {
  const result = await coinToss();
  console.log(`Toss result ${result}`);
} catch (err) {
  console.error(`Error: ${err}`);
} finally {
  console.log(`Toss completed`);
}
```

## async

One important restriction for working with `await` is that you cannot call await unless it is called at the top level of the JavaScript, or is in a function that is defined with the `async` keyword. Applying the `async` keyword transforms the function so that it returns a promise that will resolve to the value that was previously returned by the function. Basically this turns any function into an asynchronous function, so that it can in turn make asynchronous requests.

This can be demonstrated with a function that makes animal noises. Notice that the return value is a simple string.

```js
function cow() {
  return 'moo';
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: moo
```

If we designate the function to be asynchronous then the return value becomes a promise that is immediately resolved and has a value that is the return value of the function.

```js
async function cow() {
  return 'moo';
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<fulfilled>: 'moo'}
```

We then change the cow function to explicitly create a promise instead of the automatically generated promise that the await keyword generates.

```js
async function cow() {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    resolve('moo');
  });
}
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}
```

You can see that the promise is in the pending state because the promise's execution function has not yet resolved.

## await

The `async` keyword declares that a function returns a promise. The `await` keyword wraps a call to the `async` function, blocks execution until the promise has resolved, and then returns the result of the promise.

We can demonstrate `await` in action with the cow promise from above. If we log the output from invoking `cow` then we see that the return value is a promise. However, if we prefix the call to the function with the await keyword, execution will stop until the promise has resolved, at which point the result of the promise is returned instead of the actual promise object.

```js
console.log(cow());
// OUTPUT: Promise {<pending>}

console.log(await cow());
// OUTPUT: moo
```

By combining `async`, to define functions that return promises, with `await`, to wait on the promise, you can create code that is asynchronous, but still maintains the flow of the code without explicitly using callbacks.

## Putting it all together

You can see the benefit for `async`/`await` clearly by considering a case where multiple promises are required. For example, when calling the `fetch` web API on an endpoint that returns JSON, you would need to resolve two promises. One for the network call, and one for converting the result to JSON. A promise implementation would look like the following.

```js
const httpPromise = fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonPromise = httpPromise.then((r) => r.json());
jsonPromise.then((j) => console.log(j));
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: done
// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
```

With async/await, you can clarify the code intent by hiding the promise syntax, and also make the execution block until the promise is resolved.

```js
const httpResponse = await fetch('https://simon.cs260.click/api/user/me');
const jsonResponse = await httpResponse.json();
console.log(jsonResponse));
console.log('done');

// OUTPUT: {email: 'bud@mail.com', authenticated: true}
// OUTPUT: done
```

## In the following code, what does the link element do?
The `<link>` tag defines the relationship between the current document and an external resource. The `<link>` tag is most often used to link to external style sheets or to add a favicon to your website. The `<link>` element is an empty element, it contains attributes only! 

Here's an example: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`

## In the following code, what does a div tag do?
The `<div>` tag defines a division or a section in an HTML document. The `<div>` tag is used as a container for HTML elements - which is then styled with CSS or manipulated with JavaScript. The `<div>` tag is easily styled by using the class or id attribute. Any sort of content can be put inside the `<div>` tag! Note: By default, browsers always place a line break before and after the `<div>` element.

## In the following code, what is the difference between the #title and .grid selector?
The `#title` refers to an ID attribute associated with some HTML element, and the `.grid` referrs to the class attribute of some HTML element

## In the following code, what is the difference between padding and margin?
Padding represents the amount of inner space an element has, while the margin is whitespace available surrounding an element.

## Given this HTML and this CSS how will the images be displayed using flex?
The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items’ width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space or shrinks them to prevent overflow. Importantly, the flexbox layout is **direction-agnostic** as opposed to the regular layouts.

**Properties for the Parent (flex container)**:
* `display`: This defines a flex container; inline or block depending on the given value. It enables a flex context for all its direct children. 
    - `display: flex; /* or inline-flex */`
* `flex-direction`: This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container 
    - `flex-direction: row [default] | row-reverse | column | column-reverse;`
* `flex-wrap`: By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property. 
    - `flex-wrap: nowrap | wrap | wrap-reverse;`
* `flex-flow`: a short hand for the flex-direction and flex-wrap properties, which together define the flex container’s main and cross axes. The default value is row nowrap
* `justify-content`: This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line. The possible values are as follows:
    - `flex-start (default)`: items are packed toward the start of the flex-direction.
    - `flex-end`: items are packed toward the end of the flex-direction.
    - `start`: items are packed toward the start of the writing-mode direction.
    - `end`: items are packed toward the end of the writing-mode direction.
    - `left`: items are packed toward left edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like start.
    - `right`: items are packed toward right edge of the container, unless that doesn’t make sense with the flex-direction, then it behaves like end.
    - `center`: items are centered along the line
    - `space-between`: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
    - `space-around`: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren’t equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
    - `space-evenly`: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.
* `align-items`: This defines the default behavior for how flex items are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main-axis).
    - `stretch (default)`: stretch to fill the container (still respect min-width/max-width)
    - `flex-start / start / self-start`: items are placed at the start of the cross axis. The difference between these is subtle, and is about respecting the flex-direction rules or the writing-mode rules.
    - `flex-end / end / self-end`: items are placed at the end of the cross axis. The difference again is subtle and is about respecting flex-direction rules vs. writing-mode rules.
    - `center`: items are centered in the cross-axis
    - `baseline`: items are aligned such as their baselines align
* `align-content`: This aligns a flex container’s lines within when there is extra space in the cross-axis, similar to how justify-content aligns individual items within the main-axis. **Note**: This property only takes effect on multi-line flexible containers, where flex-wrap is set to either wrap or wrap-reverse
    - `normal (default)`: items are packed in their default position as if no value was set.
    - `flex-start / start`: items packed to the start of the container. The (more supported) flex-start honors the flex-direction while start honors the writing-mode direction.
    - `flex-end / end`: items packed to the end of the container. The (more support) flex-end honors the flex-direction while end honors the writing-mode direction.
    - `center`: items centered in the container
    - `space-between`: items evenly distributed; the first line is at the start of the container while the last one is at the end
    - `space-around`: items evenly distributed with equal space around each line
    - `space-evenly`: items are evenly distributed with equal space around them
    - `stretch`: lines stretch to take up the remaining space
* `gap`, `row-gap`, `column-gap`: The gap property explicitly controls the space between flex items. It applies that spacing only between items not on the outer edges.

**Properties for the Children (flex items)**
* `order`: By default, flex items are laid out in the source order. However, the order property controls the order in which they appear in the flex container. Items with the same `order` revert to source order.
* `flex-grow`: This defines the ability for a flex item to grow if necessary. It accepts a unitless value that serves as a proportion. It dictates what amount of the available space inside the flex container the item should take up. If all items have flex-grow set to 1, the remaining space in the container will be distributed equally to all children. If one of the children has a value of 2, that child would take up twice as much of the space either one of the others (or it will try, at least). Default is 0.
* `flex-shrink`: This defines the ability for a flex item to shrink if necessary.
* `flex-basis`: This defines the default size of an element before the remaining space is distributed. It can be a length (e.g. 20%, 5rem, etc.) or a keyword. The auto keyword means “look at my width or height property” (which was temporarily done by the main-size keyword until deprecated). The content keyword means “size it based on the item’s content” – this keyword isn’t well supported yet, so it’s hard to test and harder to know what its brethren max-content, min-content, and fit-content do.
* `flex`: This is the shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink` and `flex-basis` combined. The second and third parameters (flex-shrink and flex-basis) are optional. The default is 0 1 auto, but if you set it with a single number value, like flex: 5;, that changes the flex-basis to 0%, so it’s like setting flex-grow: 5; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0%;.
    ```
    .item {
        flex: none | [ <'flex-grow'> <'flex-shrink'>? || <'flex-basis'> ]
    }
    ```
* `align-self`: One item with a align-self value is positioned along the bottom of a flex parent instead of the top where all the rest of the items are. This allows the default alignment (or the one specified by align-items) to be overridden for individual flex items. Please see the align-items explanation to understand the available values.
    ```
    .item {
        align-self: auto | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline | stretch;
    }
    ```

## What does the following padding CSS do?
We'll just hope for the best on this one....


## What does the following code using arrow syntax function declaration do?


## What does the following code using map with an array output?
The `map()` creates a new array from calling a function for every array element. `map()` does not execute the function for empty elements. `map()` does not change the original array.

**Syntax**
```
array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue)
```
Parameters
* function(): Required. A function to be run for each array element.
* currentValue: Required. The value of the current element.
* index: Optional. The index of the current element.
* arr: Optional. The array of the current element.
* thisValue: Optional. Default value undefined. A value passed to the function to be used as its this value.

A good example: 
```
const persons = [
  {firstname : "Malcom", lastname: "Reynolds"},
  {firstname : "Kaylee", lastname: "Frye"},
  {firstname : "Jayne", lastname: "Cobb"}
];

persons.map(getFullName);

function getFullName(item) {
  return [item.firstname,item.lastname].join(" ");
}
// OUTPUTS: Malcom Reynolds,Kaylee Frye,Jayne Cobb
```

Yes



## Can a DNS A record can point to an IP address or another A record.
A DNS A (Address) record is specifically used to map a domain or subdomain to an IPv4 address. It cannot point directly to another A record. An A record provides a direct mapping between a domain name and an IPv4 address, allowing web browsers and other applications to locate the correct IP address to reach the associated web server or service.

If you want to create a chain or reference between DNS records, you would typically use other types of DNS records, such as CNAME (Canonical Name) records. A CNAME record allows one domain or subdomain to point to another domain or subdomain. This can be used to create aliases or to reference another hostname.

For example, if you have two domains, "example.com" and "subdomain.example.com," and you want "subdomain.example.com" to resolve to the same IP address as "example.com," you can create a CNAME record for "subdomain.example.com" that points to "example.com."

So, in summary, while A records are for mapping to IPv4 addresses, CNAME records are used for creating references or aliases between domain names.
